# TienLen
the TienLen game based on socket

<h3>About</h3>
A socketio webapp that plays the Vietnamese card game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiến_lên">TienLen</a>

<h3>Why?</h3>
I wanted to play TienLen as it was one of my favorite card game through out high school.  I tried to look for a website that would let me play against others, but I was shocked to find that it has not been made.  I also knew it was possible to make as I attended a lecture about Socket.IO in the past.  I wanted to learn more about Socket and created this app.

<h3>How was it made?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>NodeJS</b> - BackEnd
  <li><b>JQuery</b> - Event-handling and AJAX Requests
</ul>

<h3>Note</h3>
This is unfinished.  I plan on revamping this app using AngularJS seeing it is appropriate for this type of situation.
